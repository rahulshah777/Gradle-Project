# Gradle-Project

**Project Title: Spring Boot Application with Gradle Automation**

**Project Description:**
This project involves the development of a Spring Boot-based Java application that leverages Gradle 
as the build and automation tool. The objective is to build a modular, scalable, and maintainable 
application with efficient dependency management, streamlined builds, and improved developer productivity.
The project will demonstrate key aspects of modern Java backend development using Spring Boot, 
including dependency injection, RESTful APIs, data persistence using Spring Data JPA, and integration 
with a relational database (e.g., MySQL or H2). Gradle will be used for build automation, dependency 
resolution, testing, and packaging of the application.

**Key Technologies:**

1. Java 17+
2. Spring Boot
3. Spring Web
4. Spring Data JPA
5. Gradle (Groovy DSL or Kotlin DSL)
6. MySQL/H2 Database
7. Lombok (optional)
8. JUnit/Mockito for Testing

**Core Features:**

1. RESTful API development for CRUD operations
2. Entity-relationship mapping using JPA
3. Service and Repository layer abstraction
4. Build and run the project using Gradle tasks
5. Unit and integration testing via Gradle test automation

**Project Goals:**

1. Demonstrate use of Gradle as a powerful and flexible build automation tool
2. Apply Spring Boot best practices for backend development
3. Develop a maintainable and scalable project structure
4. Automate builds, tests, and deployments
